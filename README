===========
FileManager
===========

This is a simple file manager application for Qtopia. It is aimed
at developers and power users who want something similar like
FExplorer on Symbian S60. Use with caution, because of the low-level
nature of the application it is possible to corrupt your qtopia image.


Install and test
================

For the x86 emulator (QVFb) you have to start the emulator first:

	$ $QPE_X86_BUILDDIR/bin/runqtopia

Then build and run the project in the emulator:

	$ $QPE_X86_BUILDDIR/bin/qtopiamake
	$ make
	$ make install
	$ ./filemanager

To build a package for the greenphone (physical device) use the following steps:

	$ $QPE_GP_BUILDDIR/bin/qtopiamake
	$ make
	$ make package
	$ $QPE_GP_BUILDDIR/scripts/greenphone-sdk/scripts/gph -i    

Or to include FileManager in the flash image do that:

	$ $QPE_GP_BUILDDIR/bin/qtopiamake
	$ make
	$ make install
	
The next steps depend on wether you want to create a Qtopia package
or include FileManager into a flash image, please refer to the
current Qtopia documentation on how to do that.
